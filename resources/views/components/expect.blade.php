                        group of friends who love tech just as much as you do.
                        No fancy vibes, just a cool community excited to share
                        and learn.

                        We get it - talking tech can work up an appetite. We've
                        got your back with some tasty lunches. It's not just
                        about the food; it's a chance to kick back, chat, and
                        maybe make some new pals.

                        We donâ€™t do formal so you wonâ€™t see any forced handshakes
                        or awkward exchanges here. This is networking with a
                        difference. We know the conference is about making
                        connections in a way that feels natural. Take the
                        opportunity to chat with speakers, meet fellow attendees,
                        and who knows - you might just find your next project buddy.
